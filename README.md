# WordPress-Plugin-Boilderplate-webpack-composer

## Introduction

This project allows with a simple bash command to create WP plugins already organized in the object-oriented format with the added bonus of a preconfiguration of composer and webpack for more modern plugins using for example scss.

This project is based on another Open Source project from DevinVinson: [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate).

I modified the initial project structure slightly and added mostly webpack and composer.

As well as a page for plugin settings, which in my experience is useful in 90% of projects, if you don't need it just remove it.

This project is ideally aimed at those who are comfortable with the DevinVision boilderplate but who wish to save time in setting it up.

## Installation

1. To generate a new plugin it's very simple, just run the following command on the install.bash file at the root of the project:
```
bash install.bash
```
2. Follow the instructions in your terminal.
3. Go to the output folder and copy the generate folder to your plugin folder in your WordPress installation.
4. Don't forget to activate your new plugin in your WordPress.
5. Finish
